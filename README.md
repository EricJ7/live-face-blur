# live-face-blur
This project is a Python-based program that uses the OpenCV library to stream live video directly from a webcam. It provides a variety of features for interacting with the video stream, including saving frames as images and applying real-time face detection and blurring.

Features:
- Real-Time Webcam Streaming: The program captures live video from the webcam and displays it in real-time.
- Save Frames as Images: At any point during the stream, you can press a key to save the current frame as an image in the specified folder.
- Real-Time Face Blurring: With a single key press, the program detects faces in the video stream and applies a Gaussian blur over them in real time, ensuring privacy.
- Toggle Face Blurring: You can toggle off the face blurring feature to revert to an unblurred live video feed whenever needed.
